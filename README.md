Designed and implemented a comprehensive data analysis project to enhance proficiency in MySQL and Power BI skills. The project focused on analyzing member data for a health insurance provider, Orion Health Insurance. The process involved independently generating a relational database in MySQL. Subsequently, Power BI was used to develop interactive dashboards and visualizations, enabling meaningful insights into member demographics, enrollment trends, and policy related business decisions without relying on any external datasets.
