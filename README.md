# PowerBI/SQL-Data-Analysis-Orion-Health-Insurance




###  ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§  Project In Development!! ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§      

## Introduction:  

Designed and implemented a comprehensive data analysis project to enhance proficiency in MySQL and Power BI skills. The project focused on analyzing member data for a health insurance provider, Orion Health Insurance. The process involved independently generating a relational database in MySQL. Subsequently, Power BI was used to develop interactive dashboards and visualizations, enabling meaningful insights into member demographics, enrollment trends, and policy related business decisions without relying on any external datasets.

## Statistical Methods
Project implementation statistical methods are essential for summarizing data, uncovering patterns, and supporting decision-making. 

<ins> Descriptive Statistics</ins>:  These include measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. Theyâ€™re used to summarize patient demographics, claim amounts, or policy details, providing a quick snapshot of the data.

<ins>Inferential Statistics</ins>: Techniques such as hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) and confidence intervals allow analysts to draw conclusions about a population from sample dataâ€”crucial for comparing groups like policy tiers or regions.

<ins>Regression Analysis</ins>: This models relationships between variables, such as predicting claim amounts based on age or policy type, making it a go-to method for forecasting and understanding key drivers.

<ins>Time Series Analysis</ins>: For temporal data, like claims filed over months or years, this method identifies trends or seasonal patterns, which is valuable in insurance for planning and resource allocation.

<ins>Survival Analysis</ins>: Common in healthcare, this analyzes time-to-event data, such as the time until a member files a claim or cancels a policy, offering insights into customer behavior or risk.

These methods are widely applicable because they address the core needs of healthcare analytics: summarizing complex datasets, testing hypotheses, and predicting outcomes.
