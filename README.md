# PowerBI/SQL-Data-Analysis-Orion-Health-Insurance




###  ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§  Project In Development!! ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§      

## Introduction:  

To sharpen my data analysis skills and tackle a real world challenge, I designed and carried out a detailed project centered on member data for Orion Health Insurance, a health insurance provider. My goal was to leverage my expertise in MySQL and Power BI to uncover valuable insights that could inform business decisions.

I started by building a relational database in MySQL from scratch, giving me a solid foundation to store and organize the data. To ensure accuracy and consistency, I applied statistical methods and standardized processes to clean and refine the dataset crucial steps for producing reliable results. Then, using Power BI, I crafted interactive dashboards and visualizations that brought the data to life, revealing key patterns in member demographics, enrollment trends, and policy related decisions.

This project wasnâ€™t just about crunching numbers; it was about turning raw data into a clear story that could guide Orion Healthâ€™s future strategies. Through this work, I strengthened my abilities in database design, data standardization, and visualization while showing how data can drive smarter decision making.

## Statistical Methods
Project implementation statistical methods are essential for summarizing data, uncovering patterns, and supporting decision-making. 

<!--
+ Comments:
- Also, add that you needed 1,000 members / data to properly use a specific statistical methos etc.

<ins> Descriptive Statistics</ins>:  These include measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. Theyâ€™re used to summarize patient demographics, claim amounts, or policy details, providing a quick snapshot of the data.

<ins>Inferential Statistics</ins>: Techniques such as hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) and confidence intervals allow analysts to draw conclusions about a population from sample dataâ€”crucial for comparing groups like policy tiers or regions.

<ins>Regression Analysis</ins>: This models relationships between variables, such as predicting claim amounts based on age or policy type, making it a go-to method for forecasting and understanding key drivers.

<ins>Time Series Analysis</ins>: For temporal data, like claims filed over months or years, this method identifies trends or seasonal patterns, which is valuable in insurance for planning and resource allocation.

<ins>Survival Analysis</ins>: Common in healthcare, this analyzes time-to-event data, such as the time until a member files a claim or cancels a policy, offering insights into customer behavior or risk.

These methods are widely applicable because they address the core needs of healthcare analytics: summarizing complex datasets, testing hypotheses, and predicting outcomes.
